			<p class="info">The western honey bee or European honey bee is the most common of the 7-12 species of honey bee worldwide.
			Like all honey bees, the western honey bee is eusocial, creating colonies with a single fertile female (or "queen"),
			many sterile females or "workers", and small proportion of fertile males or "drones". Individual colonies can house tens of thousands of bees.
			Colony activities are organized by complex communication between individuals, through both odors and the dance language.</p>
